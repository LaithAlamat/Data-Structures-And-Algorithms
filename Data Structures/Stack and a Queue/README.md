# Singly Linked List

Create a Stack and Queue classes using LinkedLists.

## Challenge

### Stack:

1. Add a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
2. Returns the value from node from the top of the stack.
3. Returns the value of the node located at the top of the stack.

### Queue:

1. Adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
2. Removes the node from the front of the queue
3. Returns the value of the node located at the front of the queue

## Approach & Efficiency

### Stack:

- push: It has the space and time complexity of O(1).

- Peek method: It has the space and time complexity of O(1).

- Pop method: It has the space and time complexity of O(1).

- Is Empty method: It has the space and time complexity of O(1).

### Queue:

- Enqueue method: It has the space and time complexity of O(1).

- Dequeue method: It has the space and time complexity of O(1).

- Peek method: It has the space and time complexity of O(1).

- Is Empty method: It has the space and time complexity of O(1).

## API

### Stack:

- pushmethod: we add a value to the top of the stack.

- peek method: We'll return the top property.

- Is Empty: we'll check the head if it's empty we'll return true.

### Queue:

- Enqueue: we add a value to the front of the queue.

- peek method: We'll return the head value or null if empty.

- Is Empty: we'll check the head if it's empty we'll return true.
